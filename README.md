# CompositePatternAssignment
# Explanation & Code 
To build the village, at first the basic shapes were constructed which were - square, rectangle, circle, triangle and line. These basic shapes were then used to build composite shapes - house, tree and water source. 

The code above shows the base Shape class, each of the other classes inherit from this base class. The constituentShapes List contains all the basic/composite shapes needed to form a specified shape.
The house consisted of four basic shapes - a square to form the building, a triangle for the roof, a rectangle for the door and circle for the window
 
Similarly, to build a tree, a rectangle was used for the trunk, a line to represent branches, a circle for leaves and another circle for fruits. 


Finally, the water source consisted of a pond made of a circle, and a previously defined composite shape, tree.
